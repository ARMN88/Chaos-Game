# Chaos-Game
The Chaos Game is a method of creating a fractal. Made using Vanilla JavaScript.

## How It Works
Four arbitrary points, A, B, C are randomly put on a graph. You then put a dot anywhere. After picking a random point, 
move the dot half the distance to that point. Repeat this process, picking a random point each time, while keeping track
of previous dot locations. As the simulation runs, it creates a fractal, specifically the Sierpinski Triangle.
